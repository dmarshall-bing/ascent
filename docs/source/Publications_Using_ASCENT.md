- Measuring and modeling the effects of vagus nerve stimulation on heart rate and laryngeal muscles. [https://doi.org/10.1186/s42234-023-00107-4](https://doi.org/10.1186/s42234-023-00107-4)

- Fibers in smaller fascicles have lower activation thresholds with cuff electrodes due to thinner perineurium and smaller cross-sectional area. [https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/acc42b](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/acc42b)
