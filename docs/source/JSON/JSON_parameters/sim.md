# sim.json

Named file: `config/user/sims/<sim_index>.json`

## Purpose

Instructs the pipeline on which user-defined parameters to
use in constructing NEURON simulation directories (**_Sim_**). We
provide parameterized control of cuff electrode contact weighting,
fiber model and placement in the FEM, extracellular stimulation
waveform, intracellular stimulation, flags to indicate which
outputs to save (e.g., state variables of channel gating mechanisms,
transmembrane potential, intracellular stimulation), and stimulation
threshold-finding protocol ([Simulation Protocols](../../Running_ASCENT/Info.md#simulation-protocols)).

## Properties

`"pseudonym"`: This value (String) informs pipeline print statements, allowing
users to better keep track of the purpose of each configuration file. Optional.

`“n_dimensions”`: The value (Integer) is the number of parameters in
**_Sim_** for which a list is provided rather than a single value. The
user sets the number of parameters they are looping over (e.g., if
looping over waveform pulse width and fiber diameter, `n_dimensions = 2`). We included this control to prevent the user from accidentally
creating unintended NEURON simulations. The pipeline will only loop over
the first n-dimensions. Required.

`“active_srcs”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value pairs of
contact weightings for preset cuffs. Each value (`List[List[Double]]`)
is the contact weighting used to make extracellular potentials inputs
to NEURON simulations. The order of weights matches the order of parts
containing point current sources. The values should not exceed +/-1 in magnitude,
otherwise an error is thrown. For monopolar cuff electrodes, the value
should be either +1 or -1. For cuff electrodes with more than one
contact (2+), the sum of weightings should be +1, -1, or 0. If the
preset cuff is not a key in `active_srcs`, the list of contact weightings
for the “default” key is used. Required. The potentials/ for a single
fiber are calculated in the following way for the default weighting:

`"default": [[1, -1]]` // [[weight<sub>1</sub> (for src 1 on),
weight<sub>2</sub> (for src 2 on)]]

![f2]

![f3]

The value of potentials/ is applied to a model fiber in NEURON
multiplied by the stimulation amplitude, which is either from a list of
finite amplitudes or a bisection search for thresholds ([Simulation Protocols](../../Running_ASCENT/Info.md#simulation-protocols))

![f4]

`“fibers”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value pairs that
define how potentials are sampled in the FEM for application as
extracellular potentials in NEURON (i.e., the Cartesian coordinates of
the midpoint for each compartment (i.e., section or segment) along the
length of the fiber). Required.

- `“mode”`: The value (String) is the “FiberGeometry” mode that tells
  the program which fiber geometries to simulate in NEURON ([NEURON Fiber Models](../../Running_ASCENT/Info.md#implementation-of-neuron-fiber-models)). Required.

  - As listed in [Enums](../../Code_Hierarchy/Python.md#enums), known modes include

    - `“MRG_DISCRETE”` (published MRG fiber model)

    - `“MRG_INTERPOLATION”` (interpolates the discrete diameters
      from published MRG fiber models)

    - `“TIGERHOLM”` (published C-fiber model)

    - `“SUNDT”` (published C-fiber model)

    - `“RATTAY”` (published C-fiber model)

  - For a user to simulate a novel fiber type using the pipeline,
    they must define the spatial discretization of points within the
    `config/system/fiber_z.json` file to match the dimensions of the
    fiber compartments connected in NEURON. The “FiberGeometry” mode
    and parameters in the “fibers” JSON Object in **_Sim_** must
    match the keys in `config/system/fiber_z.json` to select and
    define a fiber type (e.g., MRG requires specification of fiber
    “diameters”).

- `“xy_trace_buffer”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) indicates
  the minimum required distance between the (x,y)-coordinates of a
  given fiber and the inner’s boundary. Since the domain boundaries
  are modeled in COMSOL as an interpolation curve, the exact
  morphology boundary coordinates read into COMSOL will be very close
  to (but not exactly equal to) those used in Python to seed fiber
  locations. To protect against instances of fibers falling within the
  nerve boundary traces in the exact Python traces, but not in
  COMSOL’s interpolation of those traces, we provided this
  parameter. Required.

- `“z_parameters”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value
  pairs to instruct the system in seeding fibers along the length of
  the nerve. Required.

  - `“diameter”` The value can take multiple forms to define the fiber diameter that the user is simulating in NEURON ([NEURON Fiber Models](../../Running_ASCENT/Info.md#implementation-of-neuron-fiber-models)). The value can control simulation of either fixed diameter fibers or fibers chosen from a distribution of diameters (note simulating a distribution of fiber diameters is only compatible with `“MRG_INTERPOLATION”`myelinated or unmyelinated fiber types, not `“MRG_DISCRETE”`). In **_Sim_**, only one mode of defining fiber diameters can be used. Required.

    - Fixed diameter: the value (Double or List[Double], units: micrometer) is the diameter of all fibers within the model. If using with `“MRG_DISCRETE”`, the diameters must be members of the set of published diameters.
    - Distribution of diameters: the value is a dictionary of key-value pairs to define the distribution of diameters based on the `“mode”` parameter, which can be either `“TRUNCNORM”` or `“UNIFORM”`.
      - `“TRUNCNORM”`
        - `“mode”`: “TRUNCNORM” (String). Required.
        - `“mu”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the mean diameter of the truncated normal distribution. Required.
        - `“std”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the diameter standard deviation of the truncated normal distribution. Required.
        - `“n_std_limit”`: The value (Double) is the number of standard deviations from the mean to bound the truncated normal distribution. Required.
        - `“seed”`: The value (Integer, unitless) seeds the random number generator before sampling fiber diameters.
      - `“UNIFORM”`
        - `“mode”`: `UNIFORM”` (String). Required.
        - `“upper”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the upper limit on the distribution of diameters. Required.
        - `“lower”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the lower limit on the distribution of diameters. Required.
        - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) seeds the random number generator before sampling fiber diameters.

  - `“min”`: the value (Double or List\[Double\], units: micrometer)
    is the distal extent of the seeded fiber along the length of the
    nerve closer to z = 0. Optional: if min and max are not both
    provided then the fiber length is assumed to be the proximal
    medium length (see `model.json`).

  - `“max”`: The value (Double or List\[Double\] , units: micrometer)
    is the distal extent of the seeded fiber along the length of the
    nerve closer to z = length of the proximal medium (as defined in
    `model.json`, the length of the nerve). Optional: if min and max
    are not both provided then the fiber length is assumed to be the
    proximal medium length by default.

  - `full_nerve_length`: (Boolean) Optional. If true, suppresses the warning message associated with using the full length nerve when `"min"` and `"max"` are not defined. Must be false or not defined if `"min"` and `"max"` are defined.

  - `“offset”`: The value (Double or String) is the fraction
    of the node-node length (myelinated fibers) or segment length
    (unmyelinated fibers) that the center coordinate of the fiber is
    shifted along the z-axis from the longitudinal center of the
    proximal medium. If the value is "random", the offset will
    be randomly selected between +/- 0.5 section/segment length; to
    avoid the randomized longitudinal placement, set the offset
    value to ‘0’ for no offset.

  - `“absolute_offset”`: The value (Double) is the distance (micrometers) that the center coordinate of the fiber is
    shifted along the z-axis from the longitudinal center of the
    proximal medium. This value is additive with `"offset"`.
    The shift is with respect to the model center. If a negative value is passed, the fiber will be shifted in the -z direction.
    Any offset from this parameter is cumulative with that from `"offset"`.

  - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) seeds the random number generator
    before any random offsets are created. Required only if “offset”
    is not defined, in which case the program will use a random
    offset.

- `“xy_parameters”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value
  pairs to instruct the system in seeding fiber locations at which to
  sample potentials inside inners in the nerve cross-section ([Fig 3B](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g003)). Include only _one_ version of this block in your `sim.json`
  file. Required.

  `“mode”`: The value (String) is the `“FiberXYMode”` that tells the
  program how to seed fiber locations inside each inner in the nerve
  cross-section. Required.

- As listed in [Enums](../../Code_Hierarchy/Python.md#enums), known modes include

  - `“CENTROID”`: Place one fiber at the centroid (i.e., from the
    best-fit ellipse of the inner) of each inner.

    - No parameters required.

  - `“UNIFORM_COUNT”`: Randomly place the same number of fibers in
    each inner, regardless of inner’s size.

    - `“count”`: The value (Integer) is the number of fibers per
      inner. Required.

    - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) is the seed for the random
      number generator that is instantiated before the point
      picking algorithm for fiber (x,y)-coordinates starts.
      Required.

  - `“WHEEL”`: Place fibers in each inner following a pattern of
    radial spokes out from the geometric centroid.

    - `“spoke_count”`: The value (Integer) is the number of radial
      spokes. Required.

    - `“point_count_per_spoke”`: The value (Integer) is the
      number of fibers to place on each spoke out from the
      centroid (i.e., excluding the centroid). Required.

    - `“find_centroid”`: The value (Boolean), if true, tells the
      program to include the geometric centroid as a fiber
      coordinate. Required.

    - `“angle_offset”`: The value (Double, either degrees or
      radians depending on next parameter,
      `“angle_offset_is_in_degrees”`) sets the direction of
      the first spoke in the wheel. The rest of the spokes are
      equally spaced (radially) based on the “spoke_count”.
      Required.

    - `“angle_offset_is_in_degrees”`: The value (Boolean), if
      true, tells the program to interpret `“angle_offset”` as
      degrees. If false, the program interprets `“angle_offset”` in
      radians. Required.

  - `“EXPLICIT”`: The mode looks for a `“<explicit_index>.txt”` file in the user created directory (`samples/<sample_index>/explicit_fibersets`) for user-specified fiber (x,y)-coordinates (see `config/templates/explicit.txt`). Note, this file is only required if the user is using the `“EXPLICIT”` `“FiberXYMode”`. An error is thrown if any explicitly defined coordinates are not inside any inners.

    - `“explicit_fiberset_index”`: The value (Integer) indicates which explicit index file to use.

  - `“UNIFORM_DENSITY”`: Place fibers randomly in each inner to
    achieve a consistent number of fibers per unit area.

    - `“top_down”`: The value (Boolean) dictates how the pipeline
      determines how many fibers to seed in each inner. Required.

      - If `“top_down”` is true, the program determines the
        number of fibers per inner with the `“target_density”`.
        If the number of fibers in an inner is less than the
        `“minimum_number”`, then the minimum number is used.

        - `“target_density”`: The value (Double) is the density
          (fibers/µm<sup>2</sup>). Required only if
          `“top_down”` is true.

        - `“minimum_number”`: The value (Integer) is the
          minimum number of fibers that the program will place
          in an inner. Required only if `“top_down”` is true.

      - If `“top_down”` is false (i.e., bottom-up), the program
        determines the number of fibers per unit area (i.e.,
        fiber density) with `“target_number”` and the area of the
        smallest inner. If the number of fibers in an inner is
        more than the `“maximum_number”`, then the maximum number
        is used.

        - `“target_number”`: The value (Integer) is the number
          of fibers placed in the smallest inner. Required
          only if `“top_down”` is false.

        - `“maximum_number”`: The value (Integer) is the
          maximum number of fibers placed in the largest
          inner. Required only if `“top_down”` is false.

    - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) is the seed for the random
      number generator that is instantiated before the point
      picking algorithm for fiber (x,y)-coordinates starts.
      Required.

`“waveform”`: The waveform JSON Object contains key-value pairs to
instruct the system in setting global time discretization settings and
stimulation waveform parameters ([Fig 3C](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g003)). Required.

- `“global”`: the value (JSON Object) contains key-value pairs that
  define NEURON time discretization parameters. Required.

  - `“dt”`: The value (Double, units: milliseconds) is the time step
    used in the NEURON simulation for fiber response to electrical
    stimulation. Required.

  - `“on”`: The value (Double, units: milliseconds) is the time when
    the extracellular stimulation is turned on. Required.

  - `“off”`: The value (Double, units: milliseconds) is the time when
    the extracellular stimulation is turned off. Required.

  - `“stop”`: The value (Double, units: milliseconds) is the time when
    the simulation stops. Required.

The user must also provide **_one_** of the
following JSON Objects containing “WaveformMode”-specific parameters.
The user can only loop parameters for one type of waveform in a
**_Sim_**.

```{note}
The “digits” parameter for the following “WaveformModes” sets the
precision of the unscaled current amplitude. For waveforms that are only
ever +/-1 and 0 (e.g., `MONOPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN`, `BIPHASIC_FULL_DUTY`,
`BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN`), the user can represent the waveform faithfully
with 1 digit of precision. However, for waveforms that assume
intermediate values (e.g., `SINUSOID`,
`BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN_Q_BALANCED_UNEVEN_PW`, `EXPLICIT`) more digits
of precision may be required to achieve numerical accuracy. An excessive
number of digits of precision will increase computational load and waste
storage resources.
```

```{Note}
If one of the parameter values in the `“WaveformMode”` JSON Object
is a list, then there are `n_sim/` folders created for as many waveforms
as parameter values in the list. If more than one parameter value is a
list, then there are `n_sim/` folders created for each combination of
waveform parameters among the lists (i.e., the Cartesian product).
```

    milliseconds) is the duration (“width”) of the monophasic
    rectangular pulse. Required.

  - `“pulse_repetition_freq”`: The value (Double, or List\[Double\],
    units: Hz) is the rate at which individual pulses are delivered.
    Required.

  - `“digits”`: The value (Integer) is the number of digits of
    precision used in saving the waveform to file. Required.

- `“SINUSOID”`

  - `“pulse_repetition_freq”`: The value (Double, or List\[Double\],
    units: Hz) is the frequency of the sinusoid. Required.

  - `“digits”`: The value (Integer) is the number of digits of

  Thus, the phase width (i.e., the duration of one phase in the
  symmetric pulse) is equal to half of the period, as defined by the
  specified `“pulse_repetition_freq”`. This waveform is a special case
  of `“BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN_Q_BALANCED_UNEVEN_PW”` (below).

  - `“pulse_repetition_freq”`: The value (Double, or List\[Double\],
    units: Hz) is the rate at which individual pulses are delivered.
    Required.

  - `“digits”`: The value (Integer) is the number of digits of
    precision used in saving the waveform to file. Required.

- `“BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN”`: This waveform consists of biphasic
  symmetric rectangular pulses, where the phase width (i.e., the
  duration of one phase of the symmetric pulse) is defined by
  `“pulse_width”` and the two phases of the biphasic symmetric pulses
  may be spaced by a gap defined by `“inter_phase”`. This waveform is a
  special case of `“BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN_Q_BALANCED_UNEVEN_PW”`
  (below).

    milliseconds) is the duration (“width”) of one phase in the
    biphasic rectangular pulse. Required.

    milliseconds) is the duration of time between the first and
    second phases in the biphasic rectangular pulse. Required.

  - `“pulse_repetition_freq”`: The value (Double, or List\[Double\],

- `“BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN_Q_BALANCED_UNEVEN_PW”`: This waveform
  consists of biphasic rectangular pulses that are charged-balanced
  (i.e., the charge of the first phase is equal to the charge of the
  second phase), but can be defined to be asymmetrical, such that the
  two phases can have different durations, as defined by
  `“pulse_width_1”` and `“pulse_width_2”`. Further, the two phases

  - `“scout”`: The value (JSONObject) is a set of key-value pairs specifying a previously run "scout"
    Sim for the same Sample. Use this feature to reduce CPU time required for many
    fibers placed in the same inner for a new Sim or Model. If this key is present, ASCENT will
    look for thresholds in n_sim folders in your ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH
    (i.e., the path you set in config/system/env.json) for fiber0 of each
    inner for each n_sim. The program will load this threshold value and use
    it as a starting point for the threshold bounds for each inner in your new Sim.
    The upper- and lower-bounds in the bisection search will be "bounds_search" -> "step" %
    higher and lower, respectively, of the scout Sim's fiber0 threshold. All parameters except
    fiber location (i.e., "fibers" -> "xy_location" in Sim) must match between
    the scout Sim and the current Sim, since the n_sim indices must match between the
    scout Sim and current Sim. If this key ("scout") is present, the program will ignore
    the threshold bounds "top" and "bottom" in "protocol" -> "bounds_search"
    (Unless the specified scout Sim is not found, in which case
    "top" and "bottom" will be used). Optional.
